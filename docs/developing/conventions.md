# Naming Conventions

## Annotations

You should use the following format for annotations when there are monitor specific annotations:

```bash
<monitor-name>.monitor.stakater.com/<annotation-name>
```

You should use the following format for annotations when there are global annotations:

```bash
monitor.stakater.com/<annotation-name>
```
